# Front end challenge

Mrs. Peppers produces tasteous mangos in his farm and all of your clients love him. One day Mrs. Elephant called him at night desesperated ask for him if he could deliver the maximum of mangos that he could, because he would be doing a big party in the next day with Mrs. Punky!

Mrs. Peppers wants us to help him, so we need to design a way in which he can package almost everything in his truck. So imagine that his truck is 300x192cm and his boxes is 54x42cm, so the maximum he can put on his truck 25 boxes.

Our challenge is to show how he can layout the box position so it can fit everything, or even better, if you think it is possible, suggest to him another small changes on his boxes size so it can fit more box on the truck.

Be creative!
